EDGE AI  Report :

We developed a lightweight CNN model to classify recyclable vs. non-recyclable items. The model achieved an accuracy of ~87% on the validation set. After training, the model was converted into TensorFlow Lite format to enable deployment on low-power devices like Raspberry Pi.

Edge AI Benefits:

Enables real-time inference without cloud dependency.

Ensures data privacy by processing locally.

Reduces latency, energy usage, and internet costs.

This approach is highly suitable for smart waste sorting, especially in rural or remote areas.
